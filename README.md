# Example for OpenMV and PYBoard.

## OpenMV Example

* ADXL345<br>
  ADXL345 is suitable for tilt Angle measurement

* BME280<br>
  BME280 can measure temperature, humidity and air pressure and can be applied to environmental monitoring
  
* Joystick<br>
  Read the amplitude in the X and Y of the Joystick and the value in the Z direction

* MLX90614<br>
  Get the ambient temperature and object temperature

* servo<br>
  Control servo

* AmbientLight<br>
  Calculate the light intensity by reading the adc

* DCMotor<br>
  Control dc motor
  
* LM35<br>
  LM35 is used to measure temperature. 
  
* PIRMotionSensor<br>
  Detect infrared (IR) of people/ animals in motion

* SoundSensor<br>
  Detection sound intensity
